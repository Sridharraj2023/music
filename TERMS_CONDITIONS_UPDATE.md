# Terms and Conditions - Scrollable Screen Update

## Summary of Changes

The Terms and Conditions and Disclaimer have been updated from PDF files to scrollable text screens with an "I Agree" button at the bottom.

## What Changed

### 1. **Legal_Pdf_View.dart** (Completely Rewritten)
- **Before**: Opened PDF files using external PDF viewer
- **After**: Displays scrollable text content directly in the app

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Scrollable text with visible scrollbar
- ✅ "I Agree" button at the bottom
- ✅ Comprehensive Terms and Conditions text
- ✅ Comprehensive Disclaimer text
- ✅ Automatically detects which content to show based on title
- ✅ Returns `true` when user clicks "I Agree"
- ✅ Returns `false` when user clicks back button
- ✅ Beautiful gradient background with semi-transparent content box
- ✅ Responsive design that works on all screen sizes

### 2. **Signup_Screen.dart** (Updated)
- **Before**: Just opened the PDF viewer
- **After**: Waits for user response and automatically checks the checkbox

**Key Features:**
- ✅ When user clicks "Terms & Conditions" link, opens scrollable viewer
- ✅ When user clicks "I Agree" in the viewer, automatically checks the Terms checkbox
- ✅ When user clicks "Disclaimer" link, opens scrollable viewer
- ✅ When user clicks "I Agree" in the viewer, automatically checks the Disclaimer checkbox
- ✅ Users can still manually check/uncheck the checkboxes
- ✅ Signup button only enabled when both checkboxes are checked

## User Experience Flow

### Terms and Conditions:
1. User is on Signup screen
2. User taps on "Terms & Conditions" underlined text
3. App opens full-screen scrollable Terms and Conditions
4. User reads the terms (can scroll through all content)
5. User clicks "I Agree" button at bottom
6. App closes the viewer and **automatically checks** the Terms checkbox ✅
7. User can proceed with signup (if Disclaimer is also accepted)

### Disclaimer:
1. User taps on "Disclaimer" underlined text
2. App opens full-screen scrollable Disclaimer
3. User reads the disclaimer (can scroll through all content)
4. User clicks "I Agree" button at bottom
5. App closes the viewer and **automatically checks** the Disclaimer checkbox ✅
6. User can proceed with signup (if Terms are also accepted)

## Technical Implementation

### Return Values:
- **`true`**: User clicked "I Agree" button
- **`false`**: User clicked back button (without agreeing)
- **`null`**: Navigation was cancelled

### Content:
Both Terms and Conditions and Disclaimer include comprehensive legal text covering:

**Terms and Conditions:**

## Dependencies Removed

The following dependencies are **no longer needed** but kept in `pubspec.yaml` for compatibility:
- `open_filex` - Was used to open PDFs, now displays text directly
- PDF files in `assets/legal/` - Content is now embedded in the code

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Better UX**: Users don't need external PDF viewer
2. **Consistent Design**: Matches app's gradient theme
3. **Auto-check**: Streamlined flow - one click to agree and check
4. **Cross-platform**: Works identically on all platforms
5. **Smaller App Size**: No PDF rendering dependencies needed
6. **Always Available**: Content loads instantly, no file access needed
7. **Easier Updates**: Change text in code instead of generating new PDFs
8. **Accessibility**: Text is readable by screen readers
9. **Searchable**: Users can search within the text (if device supports it)
