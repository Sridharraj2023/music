Replace with your new key:
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE
```

**Save the file!**

## Step 3: Update Test Script (Optional)

**File:** `D:\Elevate-Backend\backend\test-resend.js`

**Line 49:** Change email address to yours:
```javascript
const testEmailAddress = 'your-email@example.com';
```

---

## Step 4: Test Resend

Open terminal and run:
```bash
cd D:\Elevate-Backend\backend
node test-resend.js
```

**Expected result:**
```
✅ SUCCESS: Test email sent!
✓ RESEND IS WORKING CORRECTLY!
```

**Check your email inbox!**

```bash
npm start
```

**You should see:**
